ARGOCD
It's GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, It helps automate the deployment of applications and configurations to Kubernetes clusters.
1. Continuous Delivery:  Argo CD continuously monitors the Git repositories for changes to application manifests and automatically syncs the desired state with the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster.
    This ensures that the cluster is always in sync with the desired configuration.
2. Application Management: Argo CD provides a user-friendly web interface and CLI for managing applications deployed to Kubernetes. 
   Users can easily view the status of applications, roll back to previous versions, and perform other management tasks.
3. Multi-Environment Support: Argo CD supports deploying applications to multiple Kubernetes clusters and environments, such as development, staging, and production.
4. Rollback and Rollout Tracking: Argo CD tracks the history of application deployments and allows users to rollback to previous versions in case of issues.
